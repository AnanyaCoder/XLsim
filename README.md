XLSim: MT Evaluation Metric based on Siamese Architecture <be>


XLsim is a supervised reference-based metric that regresses on human scores provided by WMT (2017-2022). Using a cross-lingual language model XLM-RoBERTa-base [ https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base ] , we train a supervised model using a Siamese network architecture with CosineSimilarityLoss.
